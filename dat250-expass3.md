#  **DATA250 Lab 3**
####  **Johnny Nhat Trung Le**
I have split the structure up into folders. To be specific I have split it into `Components`, `Contexts` and `Styling`. 
I also have an `Images` folder in public that stores the static assets, in this case images.
In the `Components` folder the "main" components are `CreatePoll.jsx`, `CreateUser.jsx` and `VoteOnPolls.jsx`.
In addition to the creating components, I have a Modal version for them for displaying purposes.
Ignore the `TestingRouter.jsx`, this was me testing `react-router-dom`.  

To share useStates across different components, I made contexts in the form of `AppContext.jsx` and `PollContext.jsx`, stored in the `Contexts` folder.

Lastly, I have the `Styling` folder keeping all the CSS related to the components.


#### Linking the code to experiment 1-2
I have been working on the same repository since Lab 1, so everything should reside in this repo.


### Technical problems?
In this lab, I encountered no problems nor difficulties during the installation.

### Pending Issues?
I believe that all the required feature have been implemented, with some extra features. 
The only issue is that I have very minimal to none CSS, so basically no styling. 
Which is not appealing to the eye.So the user experience will not be the best, 
but functionality speaking it should be all they need.
