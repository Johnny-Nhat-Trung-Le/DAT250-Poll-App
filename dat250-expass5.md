#  **DATA250 Lab 5**
####  **Johnny Nhat Trung Le**

In this assignment I have implemented caching for the voteCounts, 
with the use of Jedis, a java client for Redis.

### Technical problems?
In this lab, I encountered no problems nor difficulties during the installation and use of Redis.

### Pending Issues?
Testing with Bruno and looking at redis-cli I believe that the tasks presented in this assignment is fulfilled.  
The test still passes, the github action workflow works and the votes gets cached in Redis. S
o therefore, I believe this assignment was a success.
